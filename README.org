1. Write a CFG in ~one.g4~ which recognizes all strings with at a substring of three ~1~s. The input strings can be of arbitrary length and can have more than three ~1~s

Examples:

#+BEGIN_src txt :tangle tests/one/one.txt :mkdirp yes
111
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_src txt :tangle tests/one/two.txt :mkdirp yes
iasdf3h235111
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_src txt :tangle tests/one/three.txt :mkdirp yes
1sges<>a11111a1g120s/ad.sdeae
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_src txt :tangle tests/one/three.txt :mkdirp yes
11111111111111111111111
#+END_src
